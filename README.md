# abs-android

Developed an application in Android Studio during a course at Jönköping University.
The application is similiar to Instagram - create an account, upload images/videos and share them with your friends.
This project just fulfilled the requirements of the course, so the application ain't responsive and the code need some refactoring!

Project made by : Simon Halling, Benjamin Gustafsson and Axel Nyberg.
